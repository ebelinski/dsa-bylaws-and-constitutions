# Proposed Bylaws IOWA CITY DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA BY-LAWS

May, 2017


## ARTICLE I Name

The name of this organization shall be Iowa City Democratic Socialists of America (ICDSA), a local affiliate (“local”) of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). The jurisdiction of ICDSA shall consist of the following counties:  Johnson, Linn


## ARTICLE II Purpose

Iowa City Democratic Socialists of America (hereinafter referred to as ICDSA) establishes the following as its primary goals and objectives:

* Providing a means by which members and supporters of Democratic Socialists of America can participate in the life of our organization;
* Openly educate and advocate for democratic socialism in our geographic area;
* Actively engage in progressive movements and struggles in the Iowa City area which are consistent with our values and vision for a democratic and humane society free from repression and exploitation. This includes, but is not limited to, the struggles against capitalism, racism, sexism, ableism, while supporting positive and affirming identity movements, including feminism and transgender equality. We also support measures to support and sustain the environment, which is constantly put at risk by the ceaseless drive for corporate profits.
* Support other DSA locals and organizing committees in Iowa and surrounding areas, to the greatest extent possible;
* Participate in the national campaigns and projects of the national DSA.

DSA as an organization is proud of our diversity, commitment to democracy, and the pluralism that is at the heart of our organization. We are not a political party, nor do we have a “party line.” We are united by our belief that capitalism is detrimental to living a genuinely free, authentic and dignified life, just as it is destructive of our health, wellbeing and environment.

Differences between members are respected and, when discussed, a spirit of fraternity and comradeship is maintained. We believe socialism represents the fullest extension of democracy, and that includes the right of all to express their views in an atmosphere that promotes participation and peace of mind.


## ARTICLE III Membership

Membership is extended to any DSA member who has paid dues to the national office, or has requested a hardship waiver, and resides in the geographic area served by the local. Members are encouraged to participate actively in activities of the national, local, and applicable branch organization, but are not required to do so.

A member may be removed from membership by submitting a letter of resignation, or for the following reasons:

* Non-payment of dues (unless a hardship waiver has been requested);
* Engaging in the harassment or violating the civil rights of another member(s);
* Credibly advocating violence or terrorism
* Severe disruption of meetings
* Being under the discipline of another organization, e.g., “vanguardist” or “democratic centralist.”

If a member is to be removed from membership for any reason other than their resignation, the member shall be notified by the Executive Committee, and shall have the right to defend themselves against the proposed removal. In such instances, a special committee shall be established for this purpose.
