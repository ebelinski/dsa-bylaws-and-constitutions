# Bylaws of the Pittsburgh Democratic Socialists of America

These bylaws have been updated to reflect the amendments passed at the Pittsburgh DSA Founding Convention on June 3, 2017.



### ARTICLE I. Name.

Pittsburgh Democratic Socialists of America (hereinafter “Pittsburgh DSA”) is a local chapter of the national organization Democratic Socialists of America.


### ARTICLE II. Purpose.

The Pittsburgh Local of the Democratic Socialists of America seeks to facilitate the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one in which the means/resources of production are democratically and socially controlled.

DSA rejects an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race and sex, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo.

DSA envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.

Our conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one. It is rooted in the belief that human beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by wealth but by popular participation, and that individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded. It is committed to a freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent, to a freedom to organize independent trade unions, women’s groups, political parties, and other formations — recognizing these as essential bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state. It is committed to a freedom of religion that acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central.

We are socialists because we are the developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision. In the present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broad democratic left. In the long run, we hope to build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality in the United States. Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society. This class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.


### ARTICLE III. Membership.

### Section 1. Membership

Members of the Pittsburgh Local DSA, also known as Pittsburgh DSA, will be those individuals whose dues to national DSA are paid in full, who reside and/or work in the Pittsburgh area. It will be the responsibility of members to approve policies and guidelines for the operation of the local chapter, to elect delegates to the national convention, to vote on matters related to national policy, and to make recommendations on issues and other matters to the National Political Committee of DSA.

### Section 2. Removal of Members

Members can be suspended or expelled if

* they are found to have harassed or acted violently against another member
