# NYC-DSA Constitution


## Article I. Name and Purpose

The name of this organization shall be the New York City Democratic Socialists of America (“the Local”). Its jurisdiction shall be the five boroughs of New York City, or such other jurisdiction as may be conferred by National DSA. Its purposes shall be consistent with those of National DSA.


## Article II. Membership

### Section 1: Definition.

The Membership of New York City DSA shall be composed of all DSA members residing within the jurisdiction of the Local. DSA members shall be defined to include all people who have paid dues to the National organization within the last two years or who have paid lifetime dues. Members in good standing will include all DSA members who have paid dues within the last year or who have paid lifetime dues. All Local members in good standing shall have full and equal rights of membership.

### Section 2: Suspension or expulsion.

Pursuant to Article III, Section 4 of the National DSA constitution, the Steering Committee shall have the power to suspend or expel members from the Local. Members can be suspended or expelled if they are found to have harassed or acted violently against another member; if they are found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of the organization; if they consistently engage in undemocratic, disruptive behavior; or if they are under the discipline of any self-defined democratic-centralist organization. Members facing suspension or expulsion must receive written notice of charges against them at least fifteen days before a meeting of the Steering Committee and must be given the opportunity to be heard before the Steering Committee. A two-thirds vote is required to suspend or expel a member. The Steering Committee will only have the power to suspend or expel a member from the Local. Only the National organization shall have the power to suspend or expel a member from the National organization. Decisions on suspension or expulsion may be appealed at the Local Convention or by Special Meeting.

### Section 3: Dues.

The Steering Committee shall have the authority to decide to raise annual dues from members of the Local. Dues shall be specified in the Bylaws, and require a two-thirds vote of the Steering Committee or a majority vote of those at the Local Convention to be changed.

## Article VII. Branches

### Section 1: Definition.

The Local may subdivide its jurisdiction into Branches for the purpose of creating smaller membership bodies that meet regularly. The purpose of a Branch will be to carry out the Local’s campaigns and to debate and discuss the organization’s political strategy. Any group of eight or more Local members of NYC-DSA, in good standing, may be recognized by the Steering Committee as a Branch. A Branch can define itself by geography, shared interest, or membership in an institution. A group of members seeking to establish itself as a Branch must apply to the Local’s Steering Committee in writing, including the names of its members; a description of purposes, functions, and membership criteria; and other information deemed necessary by the Steering Committee. A majority vote of the Steering Committee will be required to establish a Branch.

Each Branch shall maintain an official membership list. The Steering Committee will, from time to time, review the status of Branches to insure that they are in minimum compliance with the Constitution.

### Section 3: Membership.

A Branch shall define its own rules for membership in its bylaws. A Branch’s definition of its membership must be approved by the Steering Committee.

### Section 4: Representatives.

Every Branch shall elect one of its members to a seat on the Local’s Steering Committee. Every Local member may vote in only two Branch elections for Steering Committee representatives, although they may be a member of as many Branches as they wish. Young Democratic Socialists chapters in New York City may jointly elect one representative.

### Section 5: Revoking status.

A Branch may have its status revoked by a majority plus one vote of the Steering Committee following a hearing open to all Local members.


## Article VIII: Electoral Endorsements\*\*\*

### Section 1: Branch Recommendations.

Candidates running in districts wholly contained within one geographic Branch of the Local must be first recommended by a vote of sixty percent of the dues-paying members attending a meeting of that Branch. Notice must be sent to members of that Branch at least a week in advance that an endorsement will be considered at the meeting. Once a Branch recommends an endorsement, it goes to an Endorsement Meeting of the Local or to the Citywide Leadership Committee, as outlined in Sections 2 and 3.

### Section 2: Endorsement Meetings.

Ballot measures and candidates for office may only be endorsed by the Local as a whole at specified Endorsement Meetings. A sixty percent majority of the delegates attending an Endorsement Meeting will be required to endorse any candidate or ballot measure. The delegates shall be elected by the various Branches, in proportion to each Branch's number of members.

### Section 3: Special circumstances.

The Citywide Leadership Committee may endorse candidates and ballot measures in exceptional situations where time constraints forbid holding an Endorsement Meeting. A sixty percent majority is required to make an endorsement. The Citywide Leadership Committee must vote on a Branch's recommendation within four weeks of the Branch recommendation vote.


## Article IX: General Provisions

### Section 1: Interpretation.

This Constitution shall be interpreted by the Steering Committee, subject only to appeal to the Local Convention or a Special Meeting. The interpretation of the Local Convention or Special Meeting shall be final.

### Section 2: Rules.

Unless otherwise voted upon by a meeting, Robert’s Rules, newly revised (referred to also as “Robert’s Rules”) shall govern the conduct of all Conventions and Special Meetings.

### Section 3: Notifications.

All requirements for giving notice to the membership can be met by both sending emails and posting to social media.


## Article X: Amendments and Bylaws

### Section 1: Amendments.

This Constitution may be amended by a sixty percent majority of those present at the Local Convention or Special Meeting called for that purpose, provided that notice of such amendments must be given no less than fifteen days prior.

### Section 2: Bylaws\*\*\*\*.

The Bylaws may be amended by a majority of those present at the Local Convention or Special Meeting or by a two-thirds vote of the Citywide Leadership Committee.

\*\*\* As we agreed at the May 2017 convention, until a Citywide Leadership Committee is elected, the Steering Committee will continue to have the final authority to make electoral endorsements, following the rules in the old Constitution: "The Steering Committee may endorse candidates by three-quarters vote in exceptional situations where time constraints forbid holding an Endorsement Meeting."

\*\*\*\* Bylaws to be developed at a future date.
