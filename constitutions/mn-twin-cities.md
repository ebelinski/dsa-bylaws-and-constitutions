## Article I. NAME, LEGAL STATUS, TERRITORY

### Section 1. Name

The name of this organization is the Twin Cities Local of Democratic Socialists of America, hereinafter referred to as TCDSA or the Local.

### Section 2. Legal Status

This organization is recognized as a legal subsidiary of Democratic Socialists of America, a non-profit corporation registered in the state of New York, hereinafter referred to as DSA or the National. TCDSA shall be and remain registered as required by the State of Minnesota and these documents are to be filed with the Secretary of State, if so
required.

### Section 3. Territory

The territory covered by the Local is the sixteen county metropolitan area defined by the US Office of Management and Budget. This metropolitan area includes 14 Minnesota counties and 2 Wisconsin counties. See Addendum 1.


## Article II. PURPOSE

The purpose of this organization is to organize, direct, and facilitate political education and advocacy of issues for members of DSA who reside within the territory defined in Art. I, Sec. 3, and DSA members-at-large throughout Minnesota who choose to join the Local. It is further the purpose of this local to approve policies and guidelines for the operation of the local chapter, to elect delegates to the national convention, to vote on matters related to national policy, and to make recommendations on issues and other matters to the National Political Committee of DSA.

We are Socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex or any other factor, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are Democratic Socialists because we believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few.
