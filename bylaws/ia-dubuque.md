### Section 2. Removal of Members

If a full member is found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of national DSA, or if s/he is found to be consistently engaging in undemocratic, disruptive behavior, or if s/he is found to be under the discipline of any self-defined democratic centralist organization, the Local may vote to expel her/him from DSA.

The member in question must receive a copy of the written charges and notice of the meeting a minimum of two weeks before that meeting takes place. Expulsion of a member or affiliate member requires a two-thirds vote of the Local meeting. An expelled full member may appeal to the National Political Committee of DSA.

### Section 3. Pledges and Dues.

There shall be a pledge system of voluntary donations for members of DDS. The Local may establish a dues policy for the fiscal year by a vote of the membership at a General Meeting.
