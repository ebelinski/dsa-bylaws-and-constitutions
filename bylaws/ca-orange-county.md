# Bylaws of the Orange County Local Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America

Adopted on April 9, 2017



## ARTICLE I NAME
The name of the local chapter shall be the “Orange County Local Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.” The local chapter is referred to in these bylaws (the “Bylaws”) as the “OC Chapter.”


## ARTICLE II PURPOSE
The OC Chapter is a chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (“DSA”). The OC Chapter seeks to facilitate the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one in which the means and resources of production are democratically and socially controlled.

The OC Chapter rejects an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, gender and other immutable qualities, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo.

The OC Chapter envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, democratic economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.

The OC Chapter’s conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one. It is rooted in the belief that (1) human beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, (2) public policies should be determined not by the powerful or the wealthy but through popular participation, and (3) individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded. The OC Chapter is committed to a freedom of speech that does not criminalize dissent and a freedom to organize independent trade unions, women’s groups, political parties, and other similar formations that are essential bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state. The OC Chapter is also committed to a freedom of religion that protects the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central.

We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving the socialist future we envision. In the present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broad democratic left. In the long run, we will build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality in the United States. Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society, which creates a fundamental conflict of interest between those small segments of society with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.
