# DSA-North Texas Bylaws


## ARTICLE I. Name:

The name of the local shall be the Democratic Socialists of America – North Texas (DSA-North Texas).


## ARTICLE II. DSA-North Texas Strategy:

As Democratic Socialists, we believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few. We envision a society based on racial and gender equality and a fair distribution of resources.

DSA-North Texas strategy is to unite all democratic socialists into DSA. There are hundreds of democratic socialist sympathizers that live in the DFW area. Our goal is to actively ask them to join DSA so that DSA-North Texas is not a small group that believes in an idea, but a large organization that can affect the work for social and economic justice. DSA-North Texas agrees with the national DSA in supporting the movements for workers’ rights, civil rights, environmental rights, women’s rights, LGBT rights, immigrant rights, and the rights of people with disabilities. We encourage our members to actively support and participate in the work of their labor unions and advocacy groups on those issues. DSA sees our member’s efforts in these organizations as the direct work of democratic socialists.

America needs a strong labor movement and a strong left to win social justice. DSA-North Texas is committed to working on the above mentioned issues and supporting the efforts of labor unions in our area.

DSA thinks that justice for the people of the U.S. is directly Iinked to justice for people throughout the world. DSA will look for ways to take on international issues like the fight against the Trans Pacific Partnership and other not so free trade schemes.

We choose to build a democratic socialist organization that can fight for a fair and just economic and political system. We recognize the need to overcome divisions of race, gender and class in order to confront economic and social injustice. With gross inequalities of wealth and power, and so many facing the pain inflicted by a capitalist system, we choose to fight for a socialist alternative. We are the North Texas Democratic Socialists of America.

* We will hold monthly meetings advertised and open to members and supporters. Non-members who attend will be asked to join.
* Organizing co-chairs will be elected on an annual basis in November for a one year term. The co-chairs will be responsible for making day-to-day decisions and overseeing DSA-North Texas’ growth.
* DSA-North Texas committees work on issues every day in their various left issue groups. When an issue arises that our DSA members feel strongly about, a committee of volunteer DSA members will work on the issues. The DSA-North Texas co-chairs will coordinate with the issue committee co-chairs on the work. DSA-North Texas will form committees organically that reflect membership interests and avoid pro-forma committees.
