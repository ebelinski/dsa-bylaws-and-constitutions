# Bylaws


## ARTICLE I. Name and Definitions

These are the Bylaws of the South San Francisco Bay Local of the Democratic Socialists of America (“South Bay DSA”). Below, we use the term “Chapter” to refer to locals of DSA.


## ARTICLE II. Purpose

South Bay DSA seeks to build a majority movement to liberate the US from capitalism. Instead of a political-economic system serving an elite few, we envision a society based on democratic control of resources and production, and social and economic justice for all.


## ARTICLE III. Membership

### Section 1. Qualifications

Membership is open to dues-paying members of DSA who live or work in the “South Bay” (Chapter territory recognized by DSA) or nearby, who are not members of another Chapter. Voting powers and offices within South Bay DSA are reserved for members.

### Section 2. Dues

Membership dues are set by DSA and must be paid to the DSA National Office. Voluntary dues may be established by South Bay DSA or its Branches and Caucuses, but nonpayment may not restrict membership or participation. “Good standing” is determined by DSA.

### Section 3. Active Membership

Members are “active” if they have attended a South Bay DSA Chapter or Branch meeting in the last four months. Notification requirements in these Bylaws only apply for active members.

### Section 4. Removal

The Chapter shall expel a member from DSA if found to be (i) in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of DSA, (ii) consistently engaging in undemocratic or disruptive behavior, (iii) under the discipline of a self-defined democratic centralist org, or (iv) deliberately misrepresenting the positions of (or themselves as speaking for) DSA, the Chapter, or its parts.

A member must submit written charges to the Chapter Committee, which shall give fourteen days notice of a meeting (of the member’s Branch – if unclear, their nearest – or a Special Meeting in that Branch’s territory) and the charges. Expulsion requires a two-thirds vote of Chapter members present, and may be appealed to the DSA National Political Committee.

### Section 5. Code of Conduct

The Chapter may institute a Code of Conduct to elaborate on removal criteria, make recommendations on comradely behavior, and set forth grievance and mediation processes.


## ARTICLE IV. Branches

### Section 1. Territory

Branches are territory-based subgroups, and the Chapter’s primary democratic assembly. Territory may be reassigned by Chapter Committee consensus or a two-thirds Chapter vote.

### Section 2. Charter Proposal

Members who wish to form a Branch must submit a proposed charter with (i) a Branch name; (ii) territory; and (iii) signatures of at least fifteen prospective members (including Co-Chairs).

### Section 3. Membership

Each member of South Bay DSA is a member of at most one Branch, as follows:

* A member may explicitly choose their Branch at any time.
* A member may implicitly choose their Branch by primarily attending meetings of one Branch.
* Else, the member is assigned to the Branch in which they live, if there is such a Branch.
* If needed, Officers may ask the member to choose a Branch explicitly.


## ARTICLE V. Caucuses

### Section 1. Constituency

Caucuses are subgroups for a constituency (e.g., women, labor, or people of color).

### Section 2. Charter Proposal

Members who wish to form a Caucus must submit a proposed charter with (i) a Caucus name; (ii) purpose; (iii) membership criteria; (iv) Caucus Committee size; and (iv) a list of at least five prospective members (including two initial Co-Chairs) signed by those members.

### Section 3. Youth Section

Locals of the DSA Youth Section may be recognized as Caucuses by Chapter Committee consensus or the Chapter, and do not need to submit a charter.


## ARTICLE VI. Common Rules for Branches and Caucuses

### Section 1. Autonomy

Branches and Caucuses are subject to these Bylaws, but have autonomy otherwise. They must meet at least quarterly, and may adopt separate, compatible Bylaws on officer structure or matters not covered here by a three-quarters vote with fourteen days notice.

### Section 2. Active Membership

Active membership of a Branch or Caucus follows the same rules as the Chapter.

### Section 3. Chartering

Branches or Caucuses may be chartered by a two-thirds Chapter vote with fourteen days notice. The new Branch or Caucus must elect Officers within three months.


## ARTICLE VII. Voting

### Section 1. Votes

Votes of the Chapter and subgroups are conducted in person at one assembly, except that the Branch meetings collectively shall be treated as a Chapter assembly, and that the Chapter or subgroup may adopt additional rules, including rules that provide for absentee or online voting.

Each member shall have an equal vote. No member may vote at more than one Branch in a 28-day period, or vote at South Bay DSA within 28 days of voting at another Chapter of DSA.

### Section 2. Issue Endorsements

The Chapter and its Branches, Caucuses, and Working Groups may endorse statements, issues, or legislation by a two-thirds vote, but should seek to avoid contradictory positions.

### Section 3. Candidate Endorsements

The Chapter may endorse candidates for external office by a three-quarters vote.

Branches may endorse local (as determined by the Chapter Committee) candidates by a three-quarters vote, which the Chapter shall not override. The Branch may ask the Chapter to vote on seconding the endorsement, which is required if Chapter resources are to be used.

If time allows, the Chapter or Branch shall convene an Endorsements Committee to study the endorsement and solicit information, e.g. through a candidate questionnaire or invited speakers. Candidate endorsements may not be added to any Consent Agenda.

### Section 4. Required Notice and Timely Endorsements

Endorsement votes require fourteen days notice. A steering body may make timely endorsements (except of candidates) by unanimous consent, after soliciting member input.

### Section 5. Conflicts of Interest

Members shall abstain from voting on matters which place them in a conflict of interest.


## ARTICLE VIII. Elections

### Section 1. Election Method

Elections shall use Single Transferable Vote tallying (Scottish STV or a method approved by the Chapter). 50% of seats (rounded down to a whole number) in an election are reserved for members that do not self-identify as men (“non-men”). Results shall be calculated as follows:

* Let S equal the seat number to be filled. Let T equal the threshold number reserved for non-men. Let R equal the remainder, S minus T.
* Voters rank candidates on a single ballot. Use STV to produce a ranking of candidates.
* From the top S candidates in the ranking, all non-men, and up to R members who self-identify as men, shall be deemed elected.
* If fewer than T non-men are elected, transfer each voter’s ranking of non-men candidates to a separate ballot. Use STV to produce a ranking of these candidates. Additional candidates are elected from the top of this list until T non-men are elected or the list is exhausted.
* If fewer than S candidates are running, or fewer than T non-men are running, nominations from the floor shall be used to fill the remaining seats, subject to simple majority approval and the minimum number of non-men, T. If this does not succeed, the seat is vacant.

Any additional rules must be set before notice is given. The nomination period must last at least fourteen days, and the election may not end before another fourteen days.

### Section 2. Chairs and Co-Chairs

Any “Chair” role shall go to the first-ranked candidate from Section 1, Step II.

Any two “Co-Chair” roles (or similar) shall go to the top two candidates from Section 1, Step II, if at least one is a non-man. Otherwise, one co-chair role shall be assigned to the top candidate, and the second to the first non-man from the top S candidates in Step III, or to the top candidate from Step IV, or to the first non-man nominated in Step V.

### Section 3. Delegates to National, Regional, and State Bodies

Delegates and alternates to the DSA National Convention or State and Regional bodies shall be elected by the Chapter using the method in Section 1 (and Section 2, if DSA requests that a delegation chair or co-chairs to be selected), except that the vacancies in Section 1, Step V shall be filled by additional candidates of any gender from the Step II ranking and floor nominations.

All runners-up are eligible to be alternates, up to a maximum of 5 (or a different number voted on by the Chapter). Late nominations for alternates may be approved by a simple majority.
